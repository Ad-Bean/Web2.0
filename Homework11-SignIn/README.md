npm start

## Tools

- nodejs

- bootstrap
- jquery
- pug (as known as jade)
- less (it's CSS, with just a little more.)
- sha256 (to encode the password)

I've deleted the modules file, so it may take a while (about 20 to 30 seconds) to install all the dependencies.

## Others

I wanna make a **SPA** application at first, but finally give up for some reason, mainly because of the complexity of router and form handling.

By the way, i applied for a **free mongoDB cloud** as you can see in mongodb service, which is supplied by **Azure in HK** so that the website can be very slow sometimes when you register or login an account.

In all, please **be patient** when sign in or sign up when using the website.

If you run into the situation that website with no styles, try to reload the page. It's the less that might not be generated into css.

Anyway, thanks a lot.

## Update 2021-1-1

delete some useless stylesheets, and add cursor waiting when clicking sign in or sign up button
